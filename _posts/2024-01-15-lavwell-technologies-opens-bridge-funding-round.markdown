Provo, Utah--LavWell Technologies ([www.lavwell.com](www.lavwell.com)), a pioneer in the advancement of science to support wellness, has opened a bridge funding round.  Using technologies developed by the founding partners, the company is preparing a beta product launch to validate its flagship product, the Guardian Lav.  The Guardian Lav is a smart, medical toilet that monitors key health and wellness indicators with no disruption to users' daily routines.

The company anticipates moving into a limited commercial release of the Guardian Lav in Q3 2024.  The product is marketed towards assisted living markets, with a general consumer offering to follow soon after.

Jeff Campbell, CEO of LavWell Technologies, plans to apply the proceeds of the bridge funding round toward accelerating and increasing manufacturing capacity in the limited commercial release.

**Guardian Lav** The Guardian Lav is a high-quality smart toilet that gathers multiple health metrics completely passively during each bathroom visit, enabling proactive early screening of health risks and ongoing trending of wellness. Future versions of the Guardian Lav will implement additional capability for enhanced urine screening. The company expects that once the product is in place, it will become a platform for other scientists and innovators to develop new applications and sensors to monitor health and wellness for individual users.

The Guardian Lav is a luxury toilet including a bidet, heated seat, and air dryer.

**LavWell App** The LavWell app allows users to access personal health trends and provides notifications, if desired, on a mobile device or computer.  LavWell's data and trends are encrypted and HIPAA compliant to ensure privacy.  Individuals can choose to securely provide LavWell's trending information to their doctor, family, and caregivers.  Where adopted in an assisted living facility, the LavWell App gives data visibility to staff to enable improved and enhanced care for facility residents.  

"A healthcare future with realistic early prevention is now more possible than ever," said Campbell.  "The impact of actionable health notifications empowering people to make more proactive, informed descisions about their well-being is game-changing."
