# Beta Testers Wanted
LavWell Technologies is testing an innovative new product, the Guardian Lav smart wellness toilet.  The Guardian Lav passively tracks the user's hydration score and urine temperature, providing valuable wellness data and promoting healthy habits.

The Guardian Lav will feature additional personal health trends in the future, such as UTI detection, prostate health indicators, cardiovascular health indicators, and other important indicators of personal health and wellness

LavWell is actively recruiting participants for a free beta test of the Guardian Lav.

# Target Participant
LavWell is seeking beta test participants in the following categories:
- Assisted living facility residents with a private restroom
- Health conscious consumers with an interest in tracking wellness indicators

Any concerns regarding your health should be discussed with your medical provider.  LavWell Technologies makes no claim related to measurement of body temperature.
2. The Guardian Lav looks at patterns in urination frequency, duration, and consistency, which may be an indicator of changes in prostate health.
