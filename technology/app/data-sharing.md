The LavWell app gives the user complete control of personal health data.
- Default settings for all health data give visibility to the user (and to the care facility for a facility-owned device)
- Users can choose to share data with caregivers, family members, or medical providers
- Data can be shared with an invite for the recipient to create an account
- Data can be downloaded and shared in raw format
- Future development will include integration with common EHR systems
