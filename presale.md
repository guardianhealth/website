# Get on the waitlist
LavWell Technologies is rapidly developing the next-generation health monitoring and tracking device.  The Guardian Lav is completely passive, and integrates seamlessly into your daily routines.

Product delivery is expected in 2025.  Signing up on the pre-sale list is a sign of interest, and is not a binding commitment.  Facilities or users interested in an earlier look at the Guardian Lav can apply to be part of the beta test group.

Lavwell may follow up for additional details and for product research purposes.
