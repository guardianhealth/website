Over 100 million Americans have a pre-chronic illness or disease and the majority don’t even know it. Early detection matters, and will often lead to better health outcomes at lower cost. But, improving wellbeing through prevention requires a technology that is easy, convenient and fits naturally into personal “life flow.”

LavWell Technologies is a unique health and wellness startup company focused on blending miniaturized diagnostic systems, medical IoT, AI, and mobile into an automated  waste analyzer platform – a smart toilet – unobtrusively providing actionable health trends for everyday users and care providers. Within 2 years, our technology will be found in clinics, senior care, primary care, pharmacies, retail outlets, and homes. LavWell's sophisticated product captures, analyzes, and trends vital health indicators at every use of our toilet, notifies users when anomalies are detected, and provides useful history of personalized health trends.

The medical smart toilet will be a groundbreaking tool empowering users to seize greater control over their health outcomes. By seamlessly integrating advanced technology into this familiar everyday fixture, individuals gain unprecedented access to real-time health insights. This innovation will enable users to regularly monitor key health metrics such as hydration levels, kidney function, pregnancy, ovulation, blood pressure, urinary tract invection, and gastrointestinal health without the need for invasive equipment or frequent travel to medical facilities. With personalized feedback and actionable insights delivered directly to users' fingertips, they can proactively help manage their own well-being and make more informed decisions about their health.

LavWell has a strong IP position with over 50 patents issued, and additional patents pending.
