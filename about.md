> Transform the model of health and wellness management by making frequent, valuable measurements of critical health indicators a seamless part of daily routines.

Over 100 million Americans have either a prechronic illness, or a disease and the majority don’t even know it. Early detection, intervention and timely personal monitoring matters; but, improving wellbeing requires consumer interactions to be easy, convenient and fit naturally into their daily “life flow.”

LavWell Technologies is a unique biotech startup focused on blending medical IoT, AI, miniaturized assay systems, and mobile into a waste analyzer platform – a smart toilet – resolving pain points for everyday users and providers. Within 2 years, our technology will be found in clinics, senior care, primary care, pharmacies, retail outlets, and homes.

The medical smart toilet will be a groundbreaking tool empowering users to seize greater control over their health outcomes. By seamlessly integrating advanced technology into this familiar everyday fixture, individuals gain unprecedented access to real-time health insights. This innovation will enable users to regularly monitor key health metrics such as hydration levels, kidney function, pregnancy, ovulation, blood pressure, urinary tract invection, and gastrointestinal health without the need for invasive equipment or frequent visits to medical facilities. With personalized feedback and actionable insights delivered directly to users' fingertips, they can proactively help manage their own well-being and make informed decisions about their health.

LavWell has a strong IP position with over 50 patents issued, and additional patents pending.
