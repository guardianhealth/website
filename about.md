** OUR MISSION **
> Transform the model of health and wellness management by making frequent, valuable measurements of critical health indicators a seamless part of daily routines.

Over 100 million Americans have either a prechronic illness, or a disease and the majority don’t even know it. Early detection, intervention and timely personal monitoring matters; but, improving wellbeing requires consumer interactions to be easy, convenient and fit naturally into their daily “life flow.”

Guardian Health is a unique biotech startup focused on blending miniaturized assay systems, medical IoT, AI and mobile into a waste analyzer platform – a smart toilet – resolving pain points for everyday users and providers. Within 2 years, our technology will be found in clinics, senior care, primary care, pharmacies, retail outlets, and homes.

Guardian Health has a strong IP position with over 50 patents issued and pending.
